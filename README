WASTAT - WhatsApp statistics - is a toolset to extract,
and analyse data from WhatsApp chats, revived in a 
DD/MM/YYYY and 24h format. These can be obtained by
sending sending the chat in question via email, f.e.
to yourself.

(Android: In chat -> options -> more -> email chat)

How to use
==========

Most common usages are collected in the `wastat` script.
By default this script will assume your chat is in the current
directory and is called `chat.txt`. To specify a different
file, just append an argument to wastat.

Commands
=======

$ ./wastat wc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	wc - or *word count* will count how often what word
	was used and output the results, sorted, by default,
	into `words.lis` if -o is mentioned, data will also
	be outputted to STDOUT.
$ ./wastat uc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	uc - or *user count* will count how often which user
	sent a message and output the results, sorted, by
	default, into `users.lis` if -o is mentioned, data
	will also be outputted to STDOUT.
$ ./run uc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	uc - or *user count* will count how often which user
	sent a message and output the results, sorted, by 
	default, into `users.lis` if -o is mentioned, data
	will also be outputted to STDOUT.
$ ./wastat pt [chat file]
	pt - or /plot times/ will create a graph (using
	gnuplot), plotting the accumulative ammount of messages
	over all days.
$ ./wastat pd [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot dates/ will create a graph (using
	gnuplot), plotting the ammount of messages over
	time. The first and  the last date will be extracted
	automatically, and generally don't/shouldn't have to
	be changed.
$ ./wastat pu [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot users/ will create a graph (using
	gnuplot), plotting the ammount of messages over time,
	for each participant individually. The first and  the
	last date will be extracted automatically, and generally
	don't/shouldn't have to be changed. The script will ask
	you which users to include, and which not to. You will
	either be able to accept, modify (change name) or ignore.
$ ./wastat put [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot user times/ will create a graph (using
	gnuplot), plotting the ammount of messages over all days,
	for each participant individually. The plot will span from
	00:00 to 23:59.The script will ask you which users to
	include, and which not to. You will either be able to
	accept, modify (change name) or ignore.
$ ./wastat clean
  	This command removes all files that ./run might have generated.

Non-DD/MM/YYYY Files
====================

Wastat expects the DD/MM/YYYY file format to be used, and therfore
non-DD/MM/YYYY chat logs have to be converted first with `waconv`.
This script requires one argument to set the incoming language,
and will then convert any files from ARGV or STDIN. The result
will to redirected to STDOUT. Example:

$ ./waconv de chat_datei.txt > chat_file.txt

This will convert the german "chat_datei.txt" to the DD/MM/YYY
"chat_file.txt". This now can be used with wastat.

Currently the following locales are supported:
* German (de),
* United States format [MM/DD/YYY] (us).
