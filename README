WASTAT - WhatsApp statistics - is a toolset to extract,
and analyse data from WhatsApp chats, revived in US-Time
(MM/DD/YYYY). These can be obtained by sending sending 
the chat in question via email, f.e. to yourself
(Android: In chat -> options -> more -> email chat).

How to use
==========

To simplify usage, the `wastat` script exists. This script always 
assumes that the chat is saved as `chat.txt` in the current
directory but can easily be changed.

Commands
=======

$ ./wastat wc [chat file] [output file]
	wc - or *word count* will count how often what word was used
	and output the results, sorted, by default, into `words.lis`
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
$ ./wastat uc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	uc - or *user count* will count how often which user sent a
	message and output the results, sorted, by default, into `users.lis`
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
$ ./run uc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	uc - or *user count* will count how often which user sent a
	message and output the results, sorted, by default, into `users.lis`
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
$ ./wastat pt [chat file]
	pt - or /plot times/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the accumulative ammount of messages over all days.
$ ./wastat pd [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot dates/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the ammount of messages over time. The first and 
	the last date will be extracted automatically, and generally
	don't/shouldn't have to be changed.
$ ./wastat pu [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot users/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the ammount of messages over time, for each participant
	individually. The first and  the last date will be extracted
	automatically, and generally don't/shouldn't have to be changed.
	The script will ask you which users to include, and which not to.
	You will either be able to accept, modify (change name) or ignore.
$ ./wastat clean
  	This command removes all files that ./run might have generated.

Non-English Files
=================

Wastat expects the english file format to be used, and
therfore non-english chat logs have to be converted first
with "waconv". This script requires one argument to set the
incoming language, and will then convert any files from ARGV
or STDIN. The result will to redirected to STDOUT. Example:

$ ./waconv de chat_datei.txt > chat_file.txt

This will convert the german "chat_datei.txt" to the english
"chat_file.txt".

Currently the following locales are supported: German (de),
United States format [MM/DD/YYY] (us).
