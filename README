WASTAT - WhatsApp statistics - is a toolset to extract,
and analyse data from WhatsApp chats, revived in US-Time
(MM/DD/YYYY). These can be obtained by sending sending 
the chat in question via email, f.e. to yourself
(Android: In chat -> options -> more -> email chat).

How to use
==========

To simplify usage, the `run` script exists. This script always 
assumes that the chat is saved as `chat.txt` in the current
directory but can easily be changed.

Commands
=======

$ ./run wo [chat file] [output file]
	wo - or *word output* will output all words separately into
	a file, by default `words.txt`
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
$ ./run wc [chat file] [output file]
	wc - or *word count* will count how often what word was used
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
	and output the results, sorted, by default, into `words.lis`
$ ./run uc [chat file] [output file] [-o]
	uc - or *user count* will count how often which user sent a
	message and output the results, sorted, by default, into `users.lis`
	if -o is mentioned, data will also be outputted to STDOUT
$ ./run pt [chat file]
	pt - or /plot times/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the accumulative ammount of messages over all days.
$ ./run pd [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot dates/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the ammount of messages over time. The first and 
	the last date will be extracted automatically, and generally
	don't/shouldn't have to be changed.
$ ./run pu [chat file] [start] [end]
	pd - or /plot users/ will create a graph (using gnuplot),
	plotting the ammount of messages over time, for each participant
	individually. The first and  the last date will be extracted
	automatically, and generally don't/shouldn't have to be changed.
	The script will ask you which users to include, and which not to.
	You will either be able to accept, modify (change name) or ignore.
$ ./run clean
  	This command removes all files that ./run might have generated.
